       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, the user wants to know about Pune. Let me start by recalling what I know. Pune is a city in Maharashtra, India. It's also known as Poona, right? I should mention that. It's the second-largest city in Maharashtra after Mumbai. \\n\\nFirst, the history. Pune has a rich history. It was a part of the Maratha Empire, so I should talk about that. Shivaji Maharaj founded it in the 17th century. The Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Marathas, later made it their capital. That's an important point. The city has a lot of historical sites like the Shaniwar Wada and the forts like Sinhagad. Maybe the user is interested in cultural aspects too. The Marathi culture is prominent there, and the city is known for its educational institutions. IIT Bombay, IISER, and several universities are there. \\n\\nEconomically, Pune is a major hub. It has a mix of traditional industries and IT. IT parks like Hinjewadi and ITI are significant. Also, the automotive industry is big with companies like Tata and TVS having manufacturing units. The city is also a center for startups and innovation. That's a good point to include.\\n\\nGeographically, Pune is located in the Pune district, surrounded by hills. The Sahyadri range is nearby. The climate is pleasant, which makes it a popular destination. The user might be interested in tourism, so I should mention the forts, museums, and natural attractions like the Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary.\\n\\nCulturally, Pune has a vibrant community. The Osho movement is based there. There are many festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, which is celebrated with grand processions. The city also has a strong presence of Marathi cinema and music. Maybe the user wants to know about the lifestyle too. The city is known for its coffee culture and street food like Misal Pav.\\n\\nTransportation is another aspect. The Pune Metro is a recent addition. The city has good connectivity via roads and the Pune Railway Station. The airport is another point to mention.\\n\\nI should also touch on the demographics. The population is around 5 million, making it one of the fastest-growing cities. The people are a mix of traditional and modern. The city has a good infrastructure but might face challenges like urbanization and traffic.\\n\\nWait, did I miss anything? Maybe the universities and educational institutions are important for students. Also, the presence of research institutions. Oh, and the sports culture, like the MCA stadium. Also, the city's role in the freedom struggle. Maybe mention the role of leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak from there.\\n\\nI need to structure this information coherently. Start with an overview, then history, geography, economy, culture, education, tourism, and maybe some modern aspects. Keep it concise but informative. Avoid too much jargon. Make sure to highlight key points that make Pune unique, like its blend of tradition and modernity, educational institutions, IT sector, and cultural heritage. Check for any inaccuracies. For example, confirming the population figures and correct names of institutions. Also, ensure that the historical timeline is correct, like the period of the Peshwas.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Pune: A Vibrant City of Maharashtra, India**  \\nPune, formerly known as *Poona*, is a dynamic city in the state of Maharashtra, India.

It is a city of **education, innovation, and vibrant community spirit**, offering a high quality of life and cultural richness.  \\n\\nLet me know if you'd like deeper insights into any specific aspect! 🌟\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1758, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 1773, 'completion_time': 4.085881387, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.00062575, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.0557724, 'total_time': 4.086507137}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c0365-2c83-7ba3-b4a4-5579263b9f80-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 1758, 'total_tokens': 1773})"
